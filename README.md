## About

JavaScript Basics Project for the Full Stack Developer course at start2impact University

### Technical requirements

_The application must be developed with JavaScript._ 
_The use of jQuery is not allowed, and neither is the use of any frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, or others)._ 
_The use of external JavaScript libraries is allowed if necessary. The +/- buttons and the display of the counter value must be built using DOM manipulation with JavaScript._ 
_Once the elements are built with JavaScript, the function to increase and decrease the counter value must be implemented._ 
_All additional functionalities deemed necessary are allowed._

### How it works

Thanks to Water Counter, users can monitor the number of water glasses they drink in a day.
The **+** and **-** **button** makes the number increase or decrease, while the **reset** button allows to reset the number at any time. 

### Additional functionalities

By clicking the **'check' button**, a **modal window** appears with **a message that adapts to the number of glasses of water consumed**. If the number of glasses is 10 or more, a congratulatory message is displayed, while if it is less than 10, an encouraging message to drink more is shown.

*Note: The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends that healthy adults consume at least 2 liters of water per day, assuming moderate environmental temperatures and medium levels of physical activity. Based on this guideline, I have set the daily water intake to 10 standard glasses, each with a capacity of 200 milliliters.*
