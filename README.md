## About

JavaScript Basics Project for the Full Stack Developer course at start2impact University

### Technical requirements

_The application must be developed with JavaScript._ 
_The use of jQuery is not allowed, and neither is the use of any frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, or others)._ 
_The use of external JavaScript libraries is allowed if necessary. The +/- buttons and the display of the counter value must be built using DOM manipulation with JavaScript._ 
_Once the elements are built with JavaScript, the function to increase and decrease the counter value must be implemented._ 
_All additional functionalities deemed necessary are allowed._

### How it works

Thanks to Water Counter, users can monitor the number of water glasses they drink in a day.
The **+** and *-* button makes the number increase or decrease, while the *reset* button allows to reset the number at any time. 

### Languages

- HTML5
- CSS (SASS)
- JavaScript
